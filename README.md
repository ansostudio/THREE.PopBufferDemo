# THREE.PopBufferDemo

![alt text](./data/gifs/bunny_color_pop.gif)

Demo Three.js implementation of [POP Buffers](https://x3dom.org/pop/) based on original sample found [here](https://github.com/bhaettasch/pop-buffer-demo).

Note that the demo here includes a slightly modified version of Three.js in order to support interleaving data of different gl types.

Far from being complete but it works and could act as a good starting point if someone is interested to work with POP buffers in Three.js.
